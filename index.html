                <p>My name is Emily Lallier. I am originally from Connecticut, but have lived in New Hampshire for one year now, with my boyfriend and my cat, Wayne. I am the youngest of four daughters. My mother's side of the family comes from Cuba and my father's from Canada. Through my father, I obtained my Canadian citizenship in 2001 and just got my passport in 2018!</p>
                <p>My favorite thing to do is travel! I've been to various US states, Italy, Japan, Spain, Canada, France, Austria, and Germany so far. Out of all of the beautiful places I've visited, the most beautiful in my opinion is Hawaii, USA. The colors in Hawaii are some of the brightest I have ever seen. I would like to live there someday.</p>
                <p>My other hobbies include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Taking long walks - Exploring where I live by foot is the best way to see it! I love to wander up and down the old city streets, checking out every restaurant menu hung in a window that I pass!</li>
                        <li>Volunteering at my local animal shelter - I enjoy spending time with the cats at the shelter. Showing them some love before they find their forever home.</li>
                        <li>Doing jigsaw puzzles - the bigger the better! Jigsaw puzzles are a family activity that allow us to spend some quality time together.</li>
                    </ul>   </p>
