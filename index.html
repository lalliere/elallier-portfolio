                <p>My name is Emily Lallier. My favorite thing to do is travel! I've been to various US states, Italy, Japan, Spain, Canada, France, Austria, and Germany so far. Out of all of the beautiful places I've visited, the most beautiful in my opinion is Hawaii, USA. The colors in Hawaii are some of the brightest I have ever seen. I would like to live there someday.</p>
                <p>I was born and raised in southeastern Connecticut, and moved to New Hampshire about one year ago with my boyfriend and my cat, Wayne. This is our first winter here so wish me luck! You would think I am good with cold weather since I am a dual citizen of the US and Canada - but in fact, I much prefer a nice, warm 70 degree day!</p>
                <p>My other hobbies include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>Taking long walks</i> - Exploring where I live by foot is the best way to see it! I love to wander up and down the old city streets, checking out every restaurant menu hanging in a window that I pass!</li>
                        <li><i>Volunteering at my local animal shelter</i> - I enjoy spending time with the cats at the shelter. Showing them some love before they find their forever home.</li>
                        <li><i>Doing jigsaw puzzles</i> - the bigger the better! Jigsaw puzzles are a family activity that allow us to spend some quality time together.</li>
                    </ul>
